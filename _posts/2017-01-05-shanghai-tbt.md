This is one of my favorites from Shanghai. It's a mural painted on the wall of one of Shanghai's first urban farms. The farm divides two housing communities—one being among the most expensive developments in Shanghai and one being a working class complex. A door was proposed at this spot to link the two communities but never came to fruition. Nevertheless, the farm director told us children and parents from both sides of the wall now tend to the garden and participate in activities. While I really do wish this door had been built—it would have saved me 15 minutes of walking—this mural preserves the hope that one day divided communities will come together. 

Also, look at the sign at the top—I really got a kick out of what must be a reference to Platform 9 and 3/4. Maybe someday everyone will be able to find their magical train on Platform 9 and 3/4
